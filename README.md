## Task 0: Installing BGPStream and PyBGPStream
_Please have this task completed before the workshop. Contact bgpstream-info@caida.org with any problems that encounter._

For this workshop, you will need to have access to a machine with BGPStream and PyBGPStream installed. This could be on your laptop that you will have with you in the class, or on a remote server that you will access e.g., via SSH.

The [BGPStream website](https://bgpstream.caida.org) has [install instructions](http://bgpstream.caida.org/docs/install) for a variety of operating systems.
