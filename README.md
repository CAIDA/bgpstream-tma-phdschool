# BGPStream Lab, TMA PhD School 2017

## Lab Prerequisite: BGPStream and PyBGPStream
_Please ensure that you have BGPStream installed prior to attending the lab. Contact bgpstream-info@caida.org with any problems that encounter._

For this lab, you will need to have access to a machine with BGPStream and PyBGPStream installed. This could be on your laptop that you will have with you in the lab, or on a remote server that you will access e.g., via SSH.

The [BGPStream website](https://bgpstream.caida.org) has [install instructions](http://bgpstream.caida.org/docs/install) for a variety of operating systems.

## Exercises

We will work on 4 exercises in this lab. The first two are simple and designed
to get you familiar with using BGPStream, first from the command line (using
[bgpreader](http://bgpstream.caida.org/docs/tools/bgpreader)), and then
programatically from within Python (using
[PyBGPStream](http://bgpstream.caida.org/docs/api/pybgpstream)).

 - Exercise 1: [Using BGPReader](https://github.com/CAIDA/bgpstream-tma-phdschool/blob/master/exercise-1-bgpreader/README.md)
 - Exercise 2: [Using PyBGPStream](https://github.com/CAIDA/bgpstream-tma-phdschool/blob/master/exercise-2-pybgpstream/README.md)
